\mainpage 
Welcome to the documentation for the Train Operating System for CSC720.
\n Throughout the semester, you will be implementing the core features of a functional operating system for a model train!
\n While doing so, you will get hands-on experience with many important concepts of modern operating systems, including among others:
\n
\li Processes
\li Preemptive multitasking
\li Task scheduling
\li Context switches
\li Inter-process communication
\li Interrupts
\li Device drivers
\n
\section first_section Functions You Will Implement
Throughout the course you will implement the core functions of TOS in the *.c files located in the tos/kernel directory.  
\n You will be able to test your implementations using the TOS test center, explained in the lecture slides.
\n \n
\section second_section Features Provided For You
Everything else is provided for you, and it is recommended that you look around all the files to become familiar with the features and overall organization of TOS.
\n Some important features that you will use extensively later in the course include: 
\n (1) a serial line communication simulator, with which you will practice I/O through the COM1 port. 
\n (2) a train simulator, which you will use to develop and test your final project.
