## Introduction

This project contains the API documentation for the Train Operating System ("TOS"), which students in CSC720 (Advanced Operating Systems) at San Francisco State University implement throughout the semester in order to learn many concepts, such as interrupt handling, inter-process communication, etc., in a hands-on fashion.

Doxygen was used to create this documentation.  The include/kernel.h file contains the markups required to generate the documentation.   To reduce the complexity of this repository, only those files that were needed to create the documentation contained in the html directory are included here.

## Web Site

The live documentation can be accessed at [link text](http://tos.sfsu.edu/doc/).  

The documentation can also be accessed at the CSC720 TOS web site, at [link text](http://tos.sfsu.edu/).
